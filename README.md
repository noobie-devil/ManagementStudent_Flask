## Tech

**Database:** MySQL

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap. Customize the UI to meet project's requirements from [GURU Able - Free Lite Admin Template](https://github.com/technext/guruable2)

**Backend:** using Python as the primary programming language. With support from the [<ins>Flask</ins>](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) framework for building web services.

Besides, the project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
- [<ins>Flask</ins>](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) -  A micro-framework, Flask lets us build web services with very little overhead
- [<ins>WTForms</ins>](https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/) - a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python web development!
- [<ins>PyMySQL</ins>](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/#documentation) - This package contains a pure-Python MySQL client library
- [<ins>Flask-Admin</ins>](https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Solves the boring problem of building an admin interface on top of an existing data model. With little effort, it lets you manage your web serviceâ€™s data through a user-friendly interface.
